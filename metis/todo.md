• Hello, job description, what data visualization is not.
• Bolt video.
• Focus on charts, how I learned D3.

• Why learn data visualization?
• show scale: long jump, nasa launch
• describe relationships
• find outliers
• Simply: To discover and communicate information more effectively

Why would you want to show these three things?
• Why use D3?

• You certainly don't need to use it. Krugman, Nate Silver.

• javascript
• scalability
• D3 and dynamic, interactive charting are best when they use technology to do things those other forms cannot.
